## Project Vision

This website would enable users to search for exercises in a database/api. 
The user could input a set of muscles they want to target in a workout and then the website would recommend a set of workouts 
based on experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced). If a user just wanted to browse through the workouts available 
on the api they could do that too. Could also have the webapp double as a fitness/workout tracker. 
Possibly add a map to show gyms near a users location (presumably google maps api).
